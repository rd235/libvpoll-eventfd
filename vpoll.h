 *   Example of usage:
 *      // generate a file descriptor (you'll use this in poll/select/epoll...)
 *      vpollfd = vpoll_create(EPOLLOUT, FD_CLOEXEC);
 *      // when vpollfd need to signal POLLIN to all the interested poll/select/epoll (if any)
 *      vpoll_ctl(vpollfd, VPOLL_CTL_ADDEVENTS, EPOLLIN);
 *      // clear the EPOLLIN event in this way:
 *      vpoll_ctl(vpollfd, VPOLL_CTL_DELEVENTS, EPOLLIN);
 *      // VPOLL_CTL_SETEVENTS sets all the pending event map
 *      // close vpollfd when it is no longer needed:
 *      vpoll_close(vpollfd);
 *
 *   This library uses the EFD_VPOLL flag of eventfd(2) where available, or the
 *   /dev/vpoll device implemented by the vpoll kernel module.
 *   When neither of the kernel supports are available the libvpoll library
 *   implements a (partial) user-space emulation based on socketpair(2).
 *   While eventfd and the vpoll device provide full support to all the EPOLL events
 *   (including those not yet defined), the emulation code supports EPOLLIN, EPOLLOUT,
 *   EPOLLHUP only.
 *   (in emulation mode it is not possible to file further events after an EPOLLHUP).
